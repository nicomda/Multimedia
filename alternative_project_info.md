Gonna try to develop an application that allows to listen what your friend's are listening in their Smartphones at the moment.

I've been investigating and gonna put together everything i think it needs to work.

###WHAT IS SUPPOSED WE NEED

#Library to get Youtube media
To get just music files from YT, already looked for it.

#Youtube format codes
To retrieve just audio files from links.

#Youtube API to get METADATA
Cool for implement "search" as Cards in a RecyclerView with thumbnails and info

#Jackson Library to handle Jackson
Android JSON handling is just crap. That's easier way, not lazy, just clever.
